# Codex Desktop

Electron + Vite + React desktop client for Codex orchestrator.

Requirements:

- `codex-orchestrator` must be running at `http://localhost:4200`.

Install and run in development:

```bash
cd codex-desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server and the Electron main process (both in parallel). Open the Electron window to interact with the chat UI.
