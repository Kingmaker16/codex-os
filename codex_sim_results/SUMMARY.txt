TEST COVERAGE:
-------------
Step 0: Core Health Checks (Orchestrator, Mesh, SRL, Hardening)
Step 1: Strategy Simulation (Orchestrator quickRun)
Step 2: Mesh Plan Creation (DRY_RUN mode)
Step 3: Mesh Step Execution (4 sequential steps)
Step 4: Workflow Simulation (create, start, continue)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review sim_output.txt for errors
2. Identify services that need to be started
3. Re-run simulation if needed
4. Use results to validate system integration
